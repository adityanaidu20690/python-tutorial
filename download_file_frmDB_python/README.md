Project Description:
This project is a web application developed using Flask, a Python web framework. It allows users to search for employee records from a database, view the results in a tabular format, and download the results as a CSV file. The backend of the application is connected to a MySQL database (classicmodels) containing employee data, and the frontend is built with HTML forms and tables.

Key Features:
Search Employees: The application allows users to search for employees based on different fields, such as:
First Name
Last Name
Employee Number
Job Title
Email
Dynamic Results: Once a user performs a search, the application displays the results in a table, including key information about the employees.
Download Results: Users can download the search results as a CSV file, which includes the employee data in a structured format.
User-Friendly Interface: The web interface is intuitive, with a search form and result display areas. It also provides a button to download the results as a CSV.
Technologies Used:
Flask: For building the web server and routing.
MySQL: To store and manage the employee data.
Pandas: For converting the search results into a CSV format.
HTML: To create the structure of the web pages.
